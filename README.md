Pre-requisites for running a local instance of QuantImage v2
========================================================================

Software to install
************************************************************************
The following software needs to be installed in order to set up a local instance
of QuantImage v2:
    
- [Git](https://github.com/git-guides/install-git) for cloning the repositories
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install) (Docker Desktop `>=3.4` 
or Docker Engine `>=v20.10`, with Compose V2 enabled) for running the containers

Hosts file configuration
************************************************************************
In order to run the platform locally, the following entry needs to be added to 
your "hosts" file (`/etc/hosts` on Linux, `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` 
on Windows):

```127.0.0.1 keycloak```

If the line specifying `127.0.0.1 localhost` exists in the hosts file, `keycloak`
can simply be appended to the end of that line.

Browser configuration
************************************************************************
Because of restrictions regarding third-party cookies in modern browsers, 
especially for unsecured HTTP connections, problems can appear with the Keycloak
client library which checks for authentication state using an `iframe` and
cookies. To avoid issues while testing the platform on `localhost`, please use
**Firefox** as a browser and disable the **"Enhanced Tracking Protection"** 
feature for both `localhost` and `keycloak` hosts.

Ensure that the two following urls / ports have disabled enhanced tracking protection:
- `localhost:3000`
- `keycloak:8081`

MAC OSX Development
************************************************************************

On MAC OS there are a few items to be cognizant of:
- Matlab and the [qdldl](https://github.com/osqp/qdldl-python) python package do not seem to work on the M1 mac - so until this hase been fixed or these dependencies removed local dev on mac M1 is not possible.
- Mounted volumes on root (i.e `/data`) will not work due to the root folder not being writable (i.e we cannot create a new folder in `/`)
- When cloning the repos with [setup-quantimage2.sh](setup-quantimage2.sh) - the commands to clone use `--config core.autocrlf=true` option but we have
seen the line breaks not being correct everywhere when cloning on mac with this option. If you clone manually make sure to use this option.

Setting up the QuantImage v2 platform
========================================================================
Open a Terminal in the current directory, and run the following command:

```./setup-quantimage2.sh```

This will clone all the required repositories, generate secrets automatically
and ask for passwords for the Keycloak authentication platform and a sample
user for QuantImage v2 & Kheops.

It will then build all the necessary Docker images and create all the
containers required to run the platform.


Updating QuantImage v2
========================================================================

Open a Terminal in the current directory, and run the following command:

```./update-quantimage2.sh```

This will pull the latest versions of the QuantImage v2 repositories
and rebuild the Docker containers accordingly.
